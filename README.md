## diatonic-chords

**diatonic-chords** is a table of diatonic 7th chords for every mode of every key.<br>

<br>

To view the table, point your browser to this resource: `diatonic-chords/index.html`<br>

<br>

Keys may collapsed or expanded using the buttons at the top.<br>
This allows the comparison of modes for selected keys.<br>

<br>

This basic visual reference helped me further my knowledge of music theory.<br>

<br>

In the future, an extension of these tables could include the modes for harmonic and melodic keys.<br>
